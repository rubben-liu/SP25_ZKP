The Merkle tree, ecdsa verification and Poseidon hash of python and circom are all come from: https://github.com/Sdoba16/Circom-DL-course/tree/main/MerkleTree
Add subprocess calls, corresponding ecdsa generation and input.json generation to meet GitHub_ZKP
Note: download powersofTAU28_hez_final_*.ptau from https://github.com/iden3/snarkjs#7-prepare-phase-2. The file is too large to upload.
Note: The ECDSA may not pass the check since the "contribute" step requires much more RAM, and I have not test it.
